> TLDR; We have a fancy limited edition shirt. Contribute to [Malfunction Mania](https://documenso.com/blog/malfunction-mania) to get one.

We kicked off [Malfunction Mania](https://documenso.com/blog/malfunction-mania) yesterday, and the first [issues](https://github.com/documenso/documenso/issues) are coming in. As mentioned, there will be dollar bounties, but we also wanted to celebrate entering the final stage of version 1.0 with something special. This is why we created this limited edition shirt. It will only be available during the runtime of Malfunction Mania. We have yet to set an exact end date, the next event in October, however, is looming, ready to end MM.

## Documenso Merch Shop

The shirt will be available in our [merch shop](https://documen.so/shop) via a unique discount code. While the shirt will be gone after Malfunction Mania, the shop is here to stay and provide a well-deserved reward for great community members and contributors. All items can be earned by contrinuting to Documenso.
