Since we launched [Documenso 0.9 on Product Hunt](https://producthunt.com/products/documenso#documenso) last May, the team's been hard at work behind the scenes to ramp up development and design to deliver an excellent next version.

Last week, Lucas shared the reasoning how [why we're doing a rewrite](https://documenso.com/blog/why-were-doing-a-rewrite).

Today, I'm pleased to share with you a preview of the next Documenso.

## Preview the next Documenso

We redesigned the whole signing flow to make it more appealing and more convenient.

We improved the overall look and feel by making it more elegant and appropriately playful. Focused on the task at hand, but explicitly enjoying doing it.

**We call it happy minimalism.**

We paid particular attention to the moment of signing, which should be celebrated.

The image below is the final bloom of the completion celebration we added:

## Kicking off a new phase of collaboration

This preview also is the kickoff for a new phase of how we collaborate with the community.

We recently [switched to Discord](https://documenso.com/blog/switching-from-slack-to-discord) to set up a more developer-friendly, community-driven environment, and we just released the [public roadmap](https://documen.so/launches).

As always, if you have any questions or feedback, please reach out. We love to hear from you.

Best from Hamburg,

Timur
